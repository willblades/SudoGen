# SudoGen
Sudoku Generator &amp; Solver written in C++ and Qt. 
The basic idea behind the program is to randomly generate a solvable Sudoku puzzle
where either the user or the program attempts to solves it. Program solving techniques
as of current are restricted to tradtional sudoku solving techniques (finding matching
pairs, backward elimination, etc.) though heuristic techniques such as GA are planned
to be added.

- 
- Implement a way to guarantee solvable problem

- Alternative Problem solving techniques, heuristic and otherwise

- Time & Mistakes tracking 

- Program settings

- Background music (maybe)
